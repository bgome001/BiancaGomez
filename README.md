My repo for Phython Assignment
I have been a bench scientist for 10 years after receiving my Ph.D. in Genetics and Human Genetics. For the past 3 years, 
I have not worked in this field due to lack of appeal and the difficulty in balancing work and family life. I am interested in 
coding because I want to pursue a new career path as a web developer/designer. So far, I have enjoyed how creative coding can 
be while in Web Fundamentals. I am excited about learning Python and other computer languages because not only will this unique 
opportunity expand my skill set, but will  prepare me for my new career endeavors in this fast-growing area of Technology.
